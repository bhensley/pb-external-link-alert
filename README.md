External Link Alert
===============================

This is a [ProBoards](http://proboards.com) plugin.  When installed, any external links (not otherwise exempted) will first generate a popup alert, notifying your users that they are leaving your forum.  The primary reason behind this plugin is to promote user safety.

Features
---------

* Links posted by any member, with an external destination, will generate a popup when clicked.  The user then has the option to decline the link, or accept.
* Text displayed in the modal window may be customized (HTML permitted).
* Domains may be whitelisted, os that they do not generate a modal but simply allow all of your users through.
* Individual users may be exempted from the effects of the script; they will never receive notification regardless of URL destination.
